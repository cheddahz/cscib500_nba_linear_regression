# cscib500_nba_linear_regression

Using the regular seasons stats from the 2017-2018 NBA season and using Linear Regression 
to see if there is a relationship between the Minutes Played (MP) and the Player Efficiency rating (PER).

This was a project that came together last minute for a course during my first semester of grad school
and while it is anything special, it's essentially the basis of what would become my thesis disseration (hopefully soon to be published).

This repository includes the Python script and the .csv file that were used for the project
